TypeScript – Basic Setup (Without Any Library)

This document explains how to set up a simple TypeScript project without using any frameworks or libraries such as React, React Native, or Android Studio.
It also covers core TypeScript concepts like any, union types, and available data types.

How to Install TypeScript
Step 1: Initialize the Project
npm init -y

This command creates a basic package.json file for the project.

Step 2: Install TypeScript
npm install -D typescript

TypeScript is installed as a development dependency because it is only required during development and build time.

Step 3: Create TypeScript Configuration
npx tsc --init

This command generates a tsconfig.json file, which controls how TypeScript compiles code.

Project Setup
Folder Structure

Create the following folders manually:

project-root/
│
├── src/    TypeScript source files
├── dist/   Compiled JavaScript output

src contains all TypeScript files
dist contains compiled JavaScript files generated by TypeScript
Compile TypeScript
After writing TypeScript files inside the src folder, run:
npx tsc

This command compiles all TypeScript files and outputs JavaScript into the dist folder.
NPM Scripts (Optional but Recommended)
Add scripts inside package.json to simplify project commands:
npm start


These scripts help standardize build and run commands across environments.

TypeScript Concepts
any Type

The any type allows a variable to hold any value without type checking.

Why avoid any:

Disables compile-time type safety

Increases runtime errors

Removes the main benefit of using TypeScript

any should be used only when there is no better alternative.

Union Types

Union types allow a variable to hold more than one type in a controlled way.

Benefits of union types:

Maintains type safety

Accurately models real-world data

Preferred over using any

TypeScript Data Types

TypeScript supports the following main data types:
string
number
boolean
null
undefined
any
unknown
union types
arrays
objects
tuples
enums
functions
